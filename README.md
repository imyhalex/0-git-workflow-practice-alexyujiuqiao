Below is an article talking about some [statistics of software engineering](https://radixweb.com/blog/software-development-statistics). It helps us to get a better understanding of software engineering industry. 

## Most Popular Programming Language ##
It is surprising to me that JavaScript is the most popular programming language in 2024, with 22.5 million developers globally. And Python ranks second with 9 million active developers, followed by Java in third place with 8.2 million developers. 

These statistics highlight the growing importance of JavaScript, especially in web and software development, while Python's simplicity and versatility continue to attract new developers. I do understand why Python and Java is popular. But as a person that only use Javascript in the Web design class, I don't quite understand its popularity. For me, **JAVA** is the **Best** language!!!

## Github & Software Engineering ##
The widespread use of open-source code is evident, with 97% of applications incorporating it. GitHub, a leading platform for software development, now hosts 94 million developers and over 85.7 million new repositories. In 2023, GitHub saw a 38% increase in private projects, accounting for more than 80% of overall activity on the platform, setting the stage for continued growth in 2024. GitHub plays a critical role in software engineering / development. I just can't imagine the world without Github. It binds all coders and programmers together.

## Emily Huang's Comment ##

I agree with you that it is pretty surpring that JavaScript was written as the most popular programming language. Especially this year I feel like I see more people participating in Python programming over JavaScript but that might be due to our college cirriculum? I haven't written much code in JavaScript but after reading both the article and your comments I'll give it a try seeing that it is your favorite/best language. I also haven't used much GitHub but know of its impact on the programming world. I agree that it binds all coders and programmers together and am thankful to the founders and creaters of this program. Thank you for sharing this article it was a very fun read and I also enjoyed reading your comments on the subject!

It's understandable that you feel strongly about Java—it's a powerful, versatile language with a rich ecosystem, especially for enterprise applications, Android development, and backend systems. However, JavaScript's popularity isn't just about the web design aspects we typically associate it with. Its rise to the top is due to its full-stack capabilities. With frameworks like Node.js, developers can use JavaScript both on the front-end and back-end, which simplifies the development process. Plus, it’s the native language of browsers, making it essential for web development. So, while Java might be your favorite, JavaScript’s versatility and wide adoption in modern app and web development explain its dominance.
